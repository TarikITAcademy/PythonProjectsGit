print("Hello World! Today, we're going to be trying our my first program!")
print("Let's generate...a YouTube Channel name together? Yes! Let's do it!")
print("First I need You to think of a theme, something that will be on the Spotlight of Your channel, but try to make it a verb rather than a noun...")
print("...You got it? Great!")
# First Input
theme = input("What is the Theme of Your channel?\n")
print("Oh?! Good choice! Now think of something that is the co-star of the channel. It can be Your name, or a fake one?")
print("...It can be a favorite animal or an object You cherish.")
# Second Input
co_star = input("What, or who, is the Co-Star of Your channel?\n")
print("Now let's combine them!")
# Combination of Inputs
channel_name = co_star + " " + theme
# Final Output

print("Oh that is an amazing name")
